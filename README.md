This project presents an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the COVID-19 pandemic using global datasets
up to April 30, 2021. The analysis focuses on cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population statistics across countries
and continents. It combines statistical insights and data visualizations to understand the impact of the virus globally
and specifically in Canada.

1-Explore Global COVID-19 Impact by Country and Continent

Organize and analyze total deaths and vaccination data alphabetically by countries.
Highlight countries with the highest total deaths and continent-based death distributions.

2-Understand Infection and Mortality Rates

Calculate total cases and deaths percentages globally, giving insights into the fatality rate of the virus.
Determine the survival rate on the last day of reporting (2021-04-30) in Canada, which was approximately 98%.
Track total deaths as a percentage of population, emphasizing that Canada had a recorded peak death percentage of 
8.7435% on 2020-03-24, which later decreased drastically to 0.0001%.

3-Focused Insights on Canada

Examine Canada's infection rate, listed as #73 globally, with a population infection rate of 3.2546% and a reported
1,228,367 cases by the cutoff date.
Analyze Canada's vaccination progress and its relationship to decreasing fatality rates.
